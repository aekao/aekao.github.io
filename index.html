        <p>Cat Li cares about two things: video games and swoony romances. The former has meant there's not been much of the latter in her (real) life, but when she lands her dream job writing the love storylines for Compass Hollow—the next big thing in games—she knows it’s all been worth it. Then she meets her boss: the infamous Andi Zhang, who's not only an arrogant hater of happily-ever-afters determined to keep Cat from doing her job, but also impossibly, annoyingly hot.</p>
        <p>As Compass Hollow's narrative director, Andi couldn't care less about love—in-game or out. After getting doxxed by internet trolls three years ago, Andi’s been trying to prove to the gaming world that they’re a serious gamedev. Their plan includes writing the best game possible, with zero lovey-dovey stuff. That is, until the man funding the game's development insists Andi add romance in order to make the story “more appealing to female gamers.”</p>
        <p>Forced to give Cat a chance, Andi begrudgingly realizes there's more to Cat than romantic idealism and, okay, a cute smile. But admitting that would mean giving up the single player life that has kept their heart safe for years. And when Cat uncovers a behind-the-scenes plot to destroy Andi's career, the two will have to put their differences aside and find a way to work together before it's game over.</p>
